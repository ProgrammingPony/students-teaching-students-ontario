<span class="header2">Career Events</span>
<p>In the first Post Secondary Information Workshop held by STS in July 2012 here were presentations made by doctors researchers, highly successful engineers, a portfolio manager, Lawyer, Chartered Accountant and Professionals from Deloitte and Scotia Bank on how they arrived at their current careers. There were also students from a large variety of universities and programs ranging from journalism and OCAD to engineering who were available to answer questions for high school students. This event was a great opportunity to make connections with people who could help guide high school and post secondary students in fields they may be interested in.</p>

<span class="header2">Guest Lectures</span>
<p>We are currently updating our website to include many of the presentations that we commonly present along with supplementary activities and sheets. However teachers can request any presentation from us and we can try to build a new one based on the needs of the class.</p>

<span class="header2">Fundraising</span>
<p>STS occasionally hosts events to raise funds for the science fair and other associated costs.</p>
